This project is an automation engineering capstone developed for the MEC 2025 competition by a team of 4th-year students at McMaster University. The team designed and prototyped a remote-controlled automation platform using ESP32 microcontrollers, multiple DC and servo motors, Bluetooth communications, and a custom mobile app interface for user interaction.
